*Current information about the tournaments is available on Facebook events: [WOW](https://www.facebook.com/events/1147961405370364/), [HOT](https://www.facebook.com/events/595657254231053/).*

We are excited to announce two quizbowl tournaments coming up in this month, **Winter Open at Warwick (WOW)** and **Hard Oxford Tournament (HOT)**.

The University of Warwick will be hosting WOW in conjuction with UK Quizbowl at the university campus in Coventry on Saturday, 19<sup>th</sup> January. This will be an **open** tournament – anybody, be they current student or long-since graduate, is eligible to enter – with a field cap of 18 teams.

This event will be the UK mirror of the American tournament [Spartan Housewrite](http://hsquizbowl.org/db/questionsets/2185/), which is aimed at players with some previous experience of quizbowl. The difficulty is targeted at matching that of 2018’s [Cambridge Hard Autumn Tournament]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-10-01-chat-2018-announcement %}) and similar to the 2017 [ACF Regionals](http://hsquizbowl.org/db/questionsets/1897/). The question distribution can be found [here](http://hsquizbowl.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=21140), and the question set will **not** be Briticised.

There are no eligibility restrictions for this tournament. To enter a team, please fill in the form **[here](https://goo.gl/forms/1MJaFkowvqLtHtIU2)**. The provisional entry fee is £70 per team, with discounts as follows:
* <p style="font-size: 18px">£5 for bringing a fully-functional buzzer set;</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">£10 for bringing a moderator;</p>
* <p style="font-size: 18px">£10 for the whole team travelling more than 200 miles to get to Coventry.</p>

Travel information and a field list can be found on the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1147961405370364/).
